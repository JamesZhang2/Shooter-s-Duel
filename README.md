# Shooter-s-Duel
Shooters A, B, and C have a duel. They fire in turns, and in each round a shooter can only fire once. Shooter A hits his target 75% of the time, shooter B hits his target 50% of the time, and shooter C hits his target 25% of the time. They will fire until only one shooter is left, and that survivor will be the winner.
